# Dual-Band Antenna for Implantable Biomedical Devices
This project presents the design and simulation of a compact, dual-band microstrip antenna intended for use in implantable biomedical devices. The antenna is engineered to operate at 0.91 GHz and 2.45 GHz, targeting efficient wireless communication within human tissue while maintaining safety and biocompatibility.

# Project Highlights
- Dual-band operation at **0.91 GHz** and **2.45 GHz**
- Simulated using **Ansys HFSS**
- Optimised for:
  - Low return loss
  - Low SAR (Specific Absorption Rate)
  - Miniaturised footprint
- Applications include:
  - Cardiac monitoring
  - Glucose sensing
  - Neural stimulation

# Technical Focus
- Meandered and slotted patch design techniques
- SAR simulation for tissue safety compliance
- Return loss, VSWR, gain, and radiation pattern analysis
- Simulation in tissue-mimicking environment (skin model)

# Tools Used

- **Ansys HFSS** – 3D EM simulation
- **Mathematical Modeling** – Return loss, impedance, bandwidth
- **Research references** – Biomedical antenna design standards
