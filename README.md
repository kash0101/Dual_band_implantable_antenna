# Dual_band_implantable_antenna
This project presents the design and simulation of a compact dual-band microstrip antenna for implantable biomedical devices, operating at 0.91 GHz and 2.45 GHz. The antenna is optimized for low return loss, SAR compliance, and efficient wireless communication within human tissue.
